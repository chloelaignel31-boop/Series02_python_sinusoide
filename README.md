 # IEAP-python-series02: Sinusoids, from math to code

## Objective
The goal of this series is to start coding something useful, from theory to code.
The preliminary step was a homework to make clear the theory and concepts relative to sine waves and their properties.
The main point is to improve a simple piece of code that generates a sinusoide signal.
